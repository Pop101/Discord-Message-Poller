# Discord Message Poller
This simple script polls all discord messages sent by you.
`NOTE: this is a selfbot and could get you banned!`

### Why use this?
Personally, I wrote this to get all the messages I sent for training a neural net. However, it can be used for a wide number of purposes.

### Setup for beginners
Step 1: download python3
	The easiest way to do this on windows is via the microsoft store (Link to python 3.7: https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NJ46SX7X90P). 
Step 2: downloading requirements
	Simply shift+rightclick in your this project's directory and press "Open command prompt here" or "Open PowerShell here." Once it opens, execute the command `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`. This reads all the requirements from the file and installs them!
Step 3: running the program
	Open up command prompt or PowerShell again to the installed directory. Then, type `python3 poll.py` and the program will run! It will prompt you for your discord token, but also tell you how to get it (it's as easy as following these instructions: https://discordhelp.net/discord-token)
###Why does it take so long to log in?
I don't know. That being said, after the extremely long log-in time (for me at least), polling messages is rather quick. Just leave it open in the background.
